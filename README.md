# KettleLog

Kettlelog is an inventory manager designed to help business owners pinpoint exactly when an item should be reordered to avoid inventory shortages. It's easy-to-use and is always up to date, giving you the most accurate information possible. It is written completely in Java & JavaFX, and saves all user information in SQLite databases.
